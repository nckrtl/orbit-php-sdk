# Orbit PHP SDK

The typed Saloon client for the Orbit gateway API.

The SDK contains the transport defaults, response envelopes, errors, and typed
requests needed by the small public CLI surface. It does not depend on the
gateway application.

During local development, `orbit-cli` consumes this repository through a
Composer path repository with symlinking enabled.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.5
- Composer 2

## Quality

```bash
composer test       # Pest 5 with local TIA
composer test:full  # full Pest suite
composer format     # Mago formatter
composer check      # TIA tests and all Mago checks
```
