# Orbit PHP SDK rule index

Read `AGENTS.md`, then this index, before you change or review this package.
Read each rule that covers the files in scope.

## Bootstrap gate

The repository guidance is invalid when this index is missing or unreadable,
an indexed rule is missing or empty, or a material path is not covered. Stop
package work. Restore the committed guidance with
`git restore --source=HEAD -- AGENTS.md .ai/rules composer.json`, then run
`composer guidance:check`. Do not report a missing `.ai/rules/` tree as a
non-blocking observation.

This directory is a repository-owned instruction source. The SDK stays
framework-neutral. Do not add Laravel or Boost for symmetry with other Orbit
repositories.

## Rules

- [PHP and Spatie](./php-spatie.md) defines package-level PHP conventions and
  the framework boundary.
- [Saloon transport](./saloon-transport.md) defines request, DTO, envelope, and
  fake behavior.
- [Redaction and security](./redaction-security.md) defines credential,
  correlation, diagnostics, TLS, and root-CA boundaries.
- [Public contract](./public-contract.md) defines the approved small Gateway
  surface and cross-repository ownership.
- [Testing and quality](./testing-quality.md) defines Pest 5 TIA, no-TIA, Mago,
  Rector, and handoff gates.
