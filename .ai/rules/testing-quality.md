# Testing and quality

Use Pest 5 with `describe()` and `it()`. Use TDD for behavior changes. Run
focused tests for red, green, and refactor. Use Pest 5 TIA through
`composer test` during development, then run the no-TIA full suite through
`composer test:full` before handoff.

- Run `composer guidance:check` first. It must fail when the rule index, an
  indexed file, or material path coverage is missing. The failure must give the
  repository restoration command.
- Test exact methods, endpoints, query and body omission, explicit empty input,
  headers, DTO bounds, request IDs, error envelopes, redaction, object-state
  diagnostics, TLS verification, redirects, and root-CA one-shot behavior.
- Use Saloon fakes. Do not contact a live Gateway or node.
- Run `composer validate --strict` and `composer check`.
- Run Mago format check, lint, and analysis with zero findings. Run Rector in
  dry-run mode and `git diff --check`.
- Run the full no-TIA suite after TIA. Do not use a partial TIA result as the
  final suite result.
- Review the diff, staged files, branch, and upstream state before handoff.
  Never stage, commit, push, deploy, or edit a sibling repository unless the
  user explicitly authorizes that action.
